# Webstore

Welcome to my eCommerce Webstore Project! 

As someone with over 400,000 followers on Instagram I decided to start selling merchandise related to my niche page. Initially I started off with Shopify but as someone with a coding background I saw this as a great opportunity to put my learning abilities to the test.

This website is a SPA built using the MERN stack. It has all core functionalities of what you would expect from a webstore. One major functionality being it accepts payments using the Stripe API.

This project is still in development but if you'd like to take a look visit www.skylineculture.onrender.com

3. Open a terminal in the root folder and type `cd client`
4. Type `npm run build` to create a build
